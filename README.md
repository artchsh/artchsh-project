# artchsh-project
These are my side projects which im planning to combine into one utility-website. 
Im planning to do PhoneWebCam (camera from your phone can be used on you desktop by server and local hosted website)
Cash app with function that are important for me and may be usefull to you
Online version of uno, which needs to be local hosted to be able to play. Im not planning to create a fully functional online version of uno since it is already exists in Steam. 
artchsh-server is server for API and websockets which could be used in my projects
All this will be working only on Vanila JS / NodeJS, since i got bored of complexity and simplicity at the same time of react (NextJS)
